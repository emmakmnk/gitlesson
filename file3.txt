It is important that identification be accurate when returning an animal to a proposed nest. Some parents readily accept fostered conspecific young while they may destroy young of other species. Nestling raptors, for example, are notoriously difficult to identify without clues to their species. Using CDs and Internet websites to find the vocalizations of young can help identify them.
A hibernating or migratory species may be torpid or have been displaced in migration and would need to be appropriately managed.
Determining the sex of an adult is sometimes important. Many species have different weight ranges by sex, and there is frequently overlap between a large individual of the smaller sex and a smaller individual of the larger sex. In birds, what may appear to be an adult male raptor based on weight may actually be an extremely emaciated female of that species. This would affect the emaciation protocol chosen to rehabilitate the bird and would suggest the prognosis for a good outcome. In mammals, males tend to be larger than females
