Whether the decision is to admit the animal for rehabilitation or to place it back in a nest/den, safety of humans is paramount. If the caller feels comfortable handling the animal, information should be given as to the best way to ensure human safety first, and then the safety and comfort of the animal.
If it is determined that the animal should be put back in the nest or left alone, advise the caller to stay away from the area, observe at a distance, keep pets and children away, and disturb the area as little as possible. Educating the caller about the species, its place in the ecosystem, and a few interesting facts gives the caller a greater sense of investment and responsibility toward wildlife.
If in doubt as to whether or not there is cause for concern, the animal should be admitted for exam and/or observation. If the caller is transporting the animal, it is imperative that the exact location it was found is recorded. This ensures the animal canbe returned to the point of origin
