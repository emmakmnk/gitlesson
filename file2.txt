The age of an animal is important to determine. A small adult of one species may appear to be a large youngster of a different species. Developmental cues such as open eyes, denti-tion, length of tail, fully standing or sitting back on the hocks, hopping and perching, feather development, and recognition of stranger danger are all signs of growing maturation and can be helpful in determining age and maturity.
A very young mammal may require stimulation to urinate and defecate. However, young rabbits are independent when still quite small. A young bird found out of the nest may not be a nestling and putting it back in a nest may cause any siblings to jump out prematurely. In addition, the rescued nest jumper will probably not stay in a nest. Reuniting by place-ment on a branch within parental reach would be a better choice.
Whether an animal is precocial, semi-precocial,or altricialmay be an issue. A semi-preco-cial bird, for example, may run around and appear independent but may actually be learn-ing how and what to eat while continuing to gape to be fed
